 We can create an app in which we can tell the social workers that in which area people need help.<br>
What kind of help do they need.<br>
How can they help them.<br><br>

We can also tell the helpers (if they have the app)that where they can find a social worker who would be willing to help them.<br>'
We can add notifications so that the workers will knowm when there is a new person in need of help.
We can make the app such that the user will be able to help those who he/she can help.
